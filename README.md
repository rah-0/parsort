# (par)allel (sort)ing
A minimal, dependency-free Go library for parallel sorting of slices. Designed to scale across CPU cores and stay close to idiomatic Go.

## Algorithm
The algorithm built is a **parallel merge sort**, more specifically a **multiway parallel merge sort with pairwise merging**.

### Breakdown:
- **Divide phase**: The input slice is split into `N` chunks (`N = NumCPU`).
- **Parallel sort phase**: Each chunk is sorted independently using `sort.Slice` in parallel goroutines.
- **Merge phase**: All sorted chunks are merged in **parallel pairwise steps** (`logâ‚‚N steps total`).

This approach isn't a classic recursive merge sort â€” instead, it's:
- **Iterative**, not recursive.
- Uses **parallelism for both sorting and merging**.
- Merge is **pairwise**, not `N-way` (N-way can be faster for large chunk sets but more complex).

### Why not use generics?
1. Generics introduce performance overhead
    - Generic `sort.Slice` requires a comparison function (e.g., `func(i, j int) bool`).
    - This introduces:
      - **Function call overhead** for every comparison.
      - **Indirect branching**, which harms CPU branch prediction and cache locality.
    - Native sorts like `sort.Ints`, `sort.Float64s`, etc. are **heavily optimized** and compiled with inlined, tight loops and direct comparisons.
2. Avoiding heap allocations
   - Generic code may cause additional heap allocations (captured closures, interfaces).
   - Currently, allocate only when merging, minimizing GC pressure.
3. Use case is performance-focused
    - Generic versions are `1.5xâ€“2x` slower than concrete ones.
    - Each type (`int`, `float64`, `string`, etc.) gets the **best possible performance**.
    - Since this a sorting library, it's worth specializing.

## Performance
Overall, ***parsort*** can reduce ns/op by up to **90%** but at the expense of around **3** times more memory.
